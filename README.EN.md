## Principle

Replace the local DNS and replace the Microsoft server with the local server. Please install the tools involved
* An HTTP proxy that can access Google
* [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * Install the 3.8 version of **all content**

## Steps for usage

* **Important Steps** Double-click `certs/cert.crt` and select "Install Certificate", "Local Computer", "Put all certificates in the following store" (Certificate store select *Trusted Root Certification Authorities* )
* Modify the `url` in config.ini to the proxy that you can access Google
* **Run `run.bat` with administrator privileges in the current directory to start the server
* Start flight simulation
* Enjoy

## background

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 uses Bing's satellite map. However, the satellite map is relatively old, and many areas are not directly equipped with map settings a few years ago. This phenomenon occurs in different regions of the world. The map on the mainland is even 10 years ago. There are a large number of regions where satellite images are not available. Microsoft uses the program-generated map instead, and the quality is very poor. After the replacement, the image quality and details have been significantly improved, as shown in the figure below

## History and related information

I have been studying the possibility of replacing it with Google Maps for a long time, and there are also YouTubers on the Internet who have provided [some ideas](https://flightsim.to/file/4074/google-earth-decoder-optimisation-tools?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__= pmd_2902fb008a3441de2f812b093625596ad796f737-1628304162-0-gqNtZGzNAk2jcnBszQjO), use a crawler to crawl the data from Google and import it into MSFS2020. But this method is more complicated and cannot be used on a large scale.

Later I studied the network request and found that MSFS will download pictures from Bing's server. In theory, it should be possible to replace the pictures with other pictures. And it happens that the slicing method of bing and googleâ€™s satellite images is similar and can be seamlessly switched, and even Microsoft also provides the converted [source code] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/articles/ bing-maps-tile-system) (see this function QuadKeyToTileXY)

In the process of constant search, I found [examples similar to my thinking](
https://github.com/muumimorko/MSFS2020_CGLTools/issues/2#issuecomment-762232597). But his main purpose is to remove some unnecessary things to improve the quality of the landscape. He also built an additional warehouse to demonstrate a [method of using proxy to replace landscape] (https://github.com/muumimorko/MSFS2020_Proxy). Unfortunately, this warehouse lacks some necessary things and cannot operate normally.
